# kg_multitasking
Kindegarden multitasking. Something which worked with Borland C++ 3.0 well. Sometimes.

The code template was written somewhere in 1990s when I was programming Borland C++ 3.0 all the time. And I had an idea to get easy
preeptive multitasking for my simple MS-DOS programs with no cost for that. This thing worked for me for simple apps. Now I've found the code and decided to memorize it.

Let me remember it in 30 years. Say that!
