# prot386
Protected mode from MS-DOS (80386) and back

I wrote this code somewhere in the middle of 1990. Those days I got a book about 80386 protected mode.
And I was able to do the trick. Happily I did not start writing my own operating system. Because I knew about Linux already.

The thing was compilable with Borland C++ 3.0 if I'm not mistaken.

PS. Some Comments are in Russian... Sorry. But they are not vivid for the matter.

PSS. Frankly, right now I do not understand how the thing works. Really.
